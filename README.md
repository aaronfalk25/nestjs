# scratch
This repo was created to document Utemy course progress for <b>NestJS: The Complete Developer's Guide</b>.
The name "scratch" was used because this was creating a simple NestJS project from scratch.

To run this repo, open a bash terminal and run:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aaronfalk25/scratch.git
cd ./scratch
npm i
npx ts-node-dev src/main.ts
```

Once these commands are run, the app should be listening on port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/).
This project uses simple routing to differentiate between two controllers. Go bewteen http://localhost:3000/app/hi and http://localhost:3000/app/bye to see this in action.
